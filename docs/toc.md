# Inventree-Part-Templates documentation

Sorry ... documentation is not yet available.  However, the code is
working well so feel free to install it and give it a whirl.  Make sure to check the plugin settings
to configure, and then on Category and Part see the new Parts Template pane, and finally check out
the parts_templates.yaml file for filtering.
