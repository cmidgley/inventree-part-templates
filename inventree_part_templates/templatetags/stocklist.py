    """
    Filter to get a list of stock items for a part, optionally filtering by a minimum number of
    available stock items and also limited to a location.  It returns a list of StockItem objects
    that match the criteria.  If a location is specified, it should be the extact name of a 
    location, and it will match that location and any children of that location.

    QUESTION: Shouldn't this really be about allocations?  Where did I make an allocation for
    the specific BOM?  This call is generic to a part, which has benefits, but in the use case
    of a BOM, we want to see what part(s) we allocated.

    Examples:
    - {% stocklist part as stock_list %}
    - {% stocklist list.part.pk 10 as stock_list as stock_list %}
    - {% stocklist part 0 "West Assembly Building" as stock_list %}
