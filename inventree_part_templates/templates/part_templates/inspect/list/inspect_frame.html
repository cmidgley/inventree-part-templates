    Inspect frame template for the 'interactive' style of inspect for inventree-part-template plugin

    This template is used to prepare the rendering of an object from inspect (such as the explore
    filter).  It is usually used to set up style and layout for the rendering, but then delegates to
    the object template for recursive rendering of the object and it's children.

    The following context variables are available:
    - inspect: contains information about the object to render.  See the object template(s) for
      details, as usually this information is not used in this parent template.
    - object_template: the name of the child template to load for rendering the object and it's
    children.  Include the template name using `{% include object_template with object=inspect %}`.
