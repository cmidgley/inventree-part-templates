# InvenTree-Part-Templates

**InvenTree-Part-Templates** is a plugin for InvenTree that enhances the reporting capabilities,
including regular and label reports, by introducing context variables derived from category and part
templates. This plugin allows for extensive customization based on part-specific attributes and
category hierarchies, enabling users to create highly tailored template definitions.  For example,
you might have a label that uses "{{ part_templates.description }}" that resolves to "1.1K 1% 62.5mW
0402" on a resistor, but "10pF 65V Tant 1206" for a capacitor, all based on the part category and
part properties.

## Features

- **Template Customization**: Define multiple template names, each supporting its own set of
  inherited templates. This feature allows multiple templates to be customized, such as for short
  and long parametric part descriptions, and accurate category names without the full heirarchy.
  
- **Flexible Inheritance**: Templates are primarily defined per part category and are inherited from
  parent categories, but can be overridden on individual parts.  This makes templates easy to
  define, but also the ability to be highly precise down the the individual part.

- **Simplified and consistent reporting**: Easily reference templates within your reports or labels
  using standard Django template placeholders (`{{ part_templates.part_description }}`). The
  templates can be used on any report, including labels, any place where you access parts or stock.

## Example Usage

Consider a scenario where you want to create a part description template named "part_description"
using parameters from the part such as `part.Resistance` and `part.Capacitance`.

After defining a part template called `part_description`, you can refer to the following in your labeling or reporting templates:

```django
{{ part_templates.part_description }}
```

### Default Template

You can define a default template to apply across all parts unless specifically overridden:

```django
{{ part.name }}{% if part.IPN %} ({{ part.IPN }}){% endif %}
```

This default setting ensures that each part, at a minimum, is described by its name and optionally
includes the Internal Part Number (IPN) if available.

### Category-Specific Overrides

For specific categories like "Passive / Resistor", you could customize the template to highlight essential attributes:

```django
{{ part.Resistance }} {{ part.wattage }} {{ part.package }}
```

This customization would automatically apply to all sub-categories of "Resistor" unless they have their own defined templates, promoting a structured yet flexible template inheritance system.

### Part-Specific Overrides

Individual parts can also have template overrides, allowing for exceptions to the category-based templates where necessary.

## Defining part / category templates

An template is a standard Django template, just as used by InvenTree for labels and reports.  The
[context variables](https://docs.inventree.org/en/stable/report/context_variables/) provided are:

* `part`: This is the part that the report or label is working on.  If the report/label is on a
  `Stock`, this will represent the part of the stock being reported.
* `category`: This is the leaf category of the part.  It's a shorthand for `part.category`.
* `stock`: If the report is using stock, then this is the stock object.  You can test for this with
  `{% if part_templates.stock %}this is stock{% end if %}`.
* `parameters`: The parameters associated with the part.  This is a shorthand for `part.parameters`.

Some examples:

* `{{ part.name }}` will output the part name
* `{{ parameters.Resistance }}` will output the part's 'Resistence' parameter
* `{{ parameters['Rated Voltage']}}` is the syntax for parameters with spaces in their names
* `{{ category.name }} Cap: {{ parameters.Capacitance }} {{ parameters['Rated Voltage'] }} {{
  parameters['Tolerance'] }} {{ parameters['Mounting Type']}}`: Assuming the properties are defined,
  something like `Ceramic Cap: 0.1uF 50 V 10% SMT`


## Assigning templates to categories and parts

The plugin [Model Metadata](https://docs.inventree.org/en/stable/extend/plugins/metadata/) system is
used to assign templates.  A planned work item is to add a user interface using the [Panel
Mixin](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/extend/plugins/panel/), but until then you have to use
the Admin interface for `PART / Part Categories` and `PART / Parts` and hand-edit the individual
part or categories `Plugin Metadata` like this:

```json
{
    'part_template_plugin': {
        'templates': {
            'description': '{{ part.name }}'
            'category': '{{ category.parent.name }} {{ category.name }}'
        },
    }
}

The "closest" template for any one key/variable name will be used, so if a part defines "description" but not "category", and the 
category also defines "description" but not "category", and then the category parent defines "category", the template for
"description" will come from the part, and the template for "category" will come from the categories parent.  If no template is found, the
default template on the plugin setup page will be used.  If no templates are used, the resulting value will be empty (no errors, just
empty).

## Use in Reports and Labels

Using `inventree-part-template` in a label or report, once you have defined the part/category templates, is simple: a new
context variable is available called `part_templates` that has a property for each template created, using the name specified
in the plugin setup.  

For example, let's say you created `category` as the first template name, and `description` as the second.  In your report / label, you just refer to them like other context variables:

```django
{{ part_templates.category }}<br>
{{ part_templates.description }}
```

There is one special property called `error`.  This is normally `None` but is set when there was an
error processing the templates.  A best practice for a report/label might be:

```django
{% if not part_templates %}
    <div class="error">You must install inventree-part-templates first</div>
{% elif part_templates.error %}
    <div class="error">{{ error }}<div>
{% else %}
(your label/report as normal)
{% endif %}
```

## Installation

`part-templates-plugin` is [installed like most
plugins](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/extend/plugins/install/#plugin-installation-file-pip).
It can be installed with using plugins in settings, via PIP, or using the plugins.txt file
(recommended if using Docker).

## TODO

* document the 'error' property
* document a recommend label/report structure to test for existance
