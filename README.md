# InvenTree-Part-Templates


Have you invested the time and energy to get all your parts with detailed parameters, only to get
labels (and reports) like this?

`CC0603KRX7R9BB104 / 311-1344-2-ND`

With `inventree-part-templates`, you can leverage that work have parametric labels and reports:

`0603 Ceramic Cap 0.1uF 50V 10%`
`R-10K 0402 1%`
`MCU STM32: Bin A-32`

## Work in progress

This code base is getting close, but not yet ready for use.  Stay tuned...

## Introduction

**InvenTree-Part-Templates** is a plugin for InvenTree that enhances the reporting capabilities,
including regular and label reports, by introducing a `part_templates` context variable with
configurable properties derived from category and part templates.  The templates inherit across
the category heirarchy, so you can customize templates where needed, but don't have to do it every
category.

For example, you might define a template for a label called "part_description".  On the "Capacitor"
part category you might have a template that shows farads and max voltage, and on the "Resistor"
part category you might show resistance and wattage.  In your label (or report) you would simply
reference `{{ part_templates.part_description }}` and the correct template is automatically chosen
based on the part's category.  If you have a part in the "Capacitor / Electrolytic" category, but
only have a template on "Capacitor", the template on "Capacitor" would be inherited, but you can
always added (or remove) a template on "Electroylytic", or even on the part itself, to refine the
results.

## Features

- **Template Customization**: Define multiple context properties, each with its own set of inherited
  templates. For example, you can have short and long parametric part descriptions, and detailed or
  abbreviated category names, available to use in all your labels and reports.
  
- **Flexible Inheritance**: Templates are defined per part category and are inherited from parent
  categories, but can be overridden on individual parts (and have defaults).  This makes templates
  easy to define while also being able to be highly precise all the way down the the individual part.

- **Simplified and consistent reporting**: Easily reference templates within your reports or labels
  using standard Django template placeholders (such as `{{ part_templates.part_description }}`). The
  templates can be used on any report, including labels, any place where you access parts or stock.

- **Easy to configure templates with integrated panel**: A new `Parts Template` panel is (optionally)
  available on the "Part", "Stock", and "Part Category" pages.  This panel provides the ability to
  to manage the configuration and see the results of the Part Templates plugin.  On Part and Stock
  pages, you can see the rendered template value, making it easy to tune and debug your templates.
  On Part and Part Category pages you can edit the templates, where they are applied to the part and
  catalog heirarchy.

- **Control panel visibility**: The ability to view or edit the parts template can be controlled
  from settings, allowing spearate View and Edit options for Everyone, Superuser and None.

## Installation

`part-templates-plugin` is [installed like most
plugins](https://docs.inventree.org/en/latest/extend/plugins/install/).
It can be installed with using plugins in settings, via PIP, or using the plugins.txt file
(recommended if using Docker).  

This plugin requires the `Enable URL integration` plugin setting to be enabled as it needs to
perform REST API calls to InvenTree to edit and delete templates.

Don't forget to enable the plugin after adding it.


## Plugin Configuration

Under `Settings / Plugin Settings / InvenTree Part Templates` you will find the settings for the
plug-in.

## Template Configuration

## Label and Report Usage



## Example Usage

Consider a scenario where you want to create a part description template named "part_description"
using parameters from the part such as `part.Resistance` and `part.Capacitance`.

After defining a part template called `part_description`, you can refer to the following in your labeling or reporting templates:

```django
{{ part_templates.part_description }}
```

### Default Template

You can define a default template to apply across all parts unless specifically overridden:

```django
{{ part.name }}{% if part.IPN %} ({{ part.IPN }}){% endif %}
```

This default setting ensures that each part, at a minimum, is described by its name and optionally
includes the Internal Part Number (IPN) if available.

### Category-Specific Overrides

For specific categories like "Passive / Resistor", you could customize the template to highlight essential attributes:

```django
{{ part.Resistance }} {{ part.wattage }} {{ part.package }}
```

This customization would automatically apply to all sub-categories of "Resistor" unless they have their own defined templates, promoting a structured yet flexible template inheritance system.

### Part-Specific Overrides

Individual parts can also have template overrides, allowing for exceptions to the category-based templates where necessary.

## Defining part / category templates

An template is a standard Django template, just as used by InvenTree for labels and reports.  The
[context variables](https://docs.inventree.org/en/stable/report/context_variables/) provided are:

* `part`: This is the part that the report or label is working on.  If the report/label is on a
  `Stock`, this will represent the part of the stock being reported.
* `category`: This is the leaf category of the part.  It's a shorthand for `part.category`.
* `stock`: If the report is using stock, then this is the stock object.  You can test for this with
  `{% if part_templates.stock %}this is stock{% end if %}`.
* `parameters`: The parameters associated with the part.  This is a shorthand for `part.parameters`.

Some examples:

* `{{ part.name }}` will output the part name
* `{{ parameters.Resistance }}` will output the part's 'Resistence' parameter
* `{{ parameters['Rated Voltage']}}` is the syntax for parameters with spaces in their names
* `{{ category.name }} Cap: {{ parameters.Capacitance }} {{ parameters['Rated Voltage'] }} {{
  parameters['Tolerance'] }} {{ parameters['Mounting Type']}}`: Assuming the properties are defined,
  something like `Ceramic Cap: 0.1uF 50 V 10% SMT`


## Assigning templates to categories and parts

***** TO BE DONE *****

## Use in Reports and Labels

Using `inventree-part-template` in a label or report, once you have defined the part/category templates, is simple: a new
context variable is available called `part_templates` that has a property for each template created, using the name specified
in the plugin setup.  

For example, let's say you created `category` as the first template name, and `description` as the second.  In your report / label, you just refer to them like other context variables:

```django
{{ part_templates.category }}<br>
{{ part_templates.description }}
```

There is one special property called `error`.  This is normally `None` but is set when there was an
error processing the templates.  A best practice for a report/label might be:

```django
{% if not part_templates %}
    <div class="error">Plugin inventree-part-templates required</div>
{% elif part_templates.error %}
    <div class="error">{{ error }}<div>
{% else %}
(your label/report as normal)
{% endif %}
```

## TODO

* document the 'error' property
* document a recommend label/report structure to test for existance
* document the yaml file (and [RegEx tester recommenation](https://regex101.com/))
